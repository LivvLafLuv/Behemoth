# Behemoth (Formerly known as UwURevenge)

Behemoth is my brainchild from SIUEs eHacks 2019 hackathon. It is a space-themed arcade dog-fighting game that employed a custom arduino controller that would hook up to EKG sensors placed on a players preferred muscle groups.

## How to run

Behemoth uses Unity/C# for the entirety of its codebase. Currently attempting to bring it into a new version of Unity to continue its development.
