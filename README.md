# Behemoth 
### *Formerly known as [UwURevenge](https://github.com/uwurevenge/UwURevenge/tree/master)

The winner of SIUEs eHacks 2019 Hackathon BEST OVERALL, Behemoth is a space-themed arcade dog-fighting game that employs a custom arduino controller that hooks up to EKG sensors placed on a players preferred muscle groups. The player is thrown into an ongoing space battle between two gargantuan battleships. The object is to gather your allies and destroy key points on the enemy battleship before your own is destroyed while avoiding hazards and enemy fighters. The player can select from multiple custom controller (mouse and keyboard, a custom banana based controller, and the FLEX controller).

## Custom Arduino controller

Our hackathon team had developed a custom and reusable circuit and arduino controller to play the game the way it was intended to be played -- by flexing ü¶æ (or bananas üçå).

## This $#!% is bananas

The first custom controller we produced for Behemoth was the banana controller. A quick proof of concept that was the result of breakfast the day of judging, we zip-tied five un-eaten bananas to an empty Dunkin Donuts box. The player could tap on single or chords of bananas to allow for a huge amount of possible commands.

## Time to FLEX

Our greatest achievement -- the FLEX gamemode -- would see a member of the dev team connect three EKG sensors to the player's body, calibrate it for their muscle contractions, and allow the player to play Behemoth with a customized controller that would react to their body movements.

## How to run

Behemoth uses Unity/C# for the entirety of its codebase. Currently attempting to bring it into a new version of Unity to continue its development.
